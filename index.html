            My name is Ignacio Leonel Sanchez, I’m from Neuquen, Argentina and I’m 24 years old. I
            returned from
            my mission 3 years ago and I set many goals some of which I’m already acheving, and
            others that
            remain to be accomplished. I’m so Happy to be able to learn Programing and I am loooking
            forward to creating my own website! I want to work as Full Stack Programmer and create
            five projects as soon as
            posible!
